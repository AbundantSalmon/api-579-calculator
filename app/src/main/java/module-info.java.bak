// Temporarily used to modularise the app, but due to current want of making a fat app
// with that is able to be run on any platform (win, mac, linux)
// modularity is currently stripped (i.e. .bak). If modularity enabled, app would need to be
// built individually for each platform due to java 11 not including javafx in the jdk
// and each platform requiring it's own binaries. Currently a hack in the build.gradle
// enables the inclusion of all necessary platform binaries but that prevents
// modularisation. Also since the app is not modular, UiFX has been split off from
// App cannot extend Application as well as have main, because it cannot be called when
// Application has not been loaded (modular).
//
// Potentially in the future, change back to modular and implement a build pipeline which
// complies separate builds for each platform every build.
