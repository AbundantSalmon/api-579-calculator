# API 579-1 (2016) Fitness-for-Service
The program will be able to perform basic calculations (Level 1 for now) as per Part 4 - Assessment of General Metal Loss.

## Part 4 - Assessment of General Metal Loss Level 1

### Flow
    1. Determine t_min
    2. Thickness measurements of metal on equipment
        1. Point thickness readings
        2. Inspection planes and take thickness profile data
            1. Determine t_mm and L
            2. Determine CTP's inthe longitudinal and circumferential directions
            3. Determine s, c, and t_am for the CTP's
    3. Determine type B or C component
    4. Perform calculations based on conditions
    5. Determine if successful or need to send them to level 2 or level 3
        
### Assumptions
    1. Only assessing piping
    2. Not in cyclic service.

                1. Nominal Thickness
            3. Straight or Elbow
                1. Radius if Elbow
            4. Temperature // Later
            5. Design Pressure
            6. Design Allowable Stress
            7. Quality Factor (E)
            8. Weld Joint strength reduction (W)
            9. Y Coefficent
            10. Corrosion allowance (CA)
    2. Thickness readings 
        1. Measurement Date // Later
        2. Point thickness (Minimum of 15 thickness recommended)
        3. Thickness profiles // Later
        4. Measurement location (Elbow Introdos/Extrados)
    3. User/Inspector/Engineer Data
        1. Report Date
        2. ID
    4. Applicability Questions
    5. Corrosion rate


### Outputs
    1. Point thickness
        1. t_mm
        2. t_am
        3. COV
        4. Average measured thickness or MAWP acceptance criterion
    2. Critical Thickness Profile
        1. t_mm
        2. t_ml
        3. D_ml
        4. R_t
        5. L
        6. t^s_am
        7. t^c_am
        8. Average measured thickness or MAWP acceptance criterion
    3. Graphical Representation
        1. Remaining life R_life
    4. Suggestion of result


### Calculations
    1. If thickness readings Coefficient Of Variation (COV) is greater than 10%, the warn user than thickness profiles should be used instead
    2.
